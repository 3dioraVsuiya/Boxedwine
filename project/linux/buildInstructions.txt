On Ubuntu 20.04 the follow packages need to be installed

cmake
build-essential
libsdl2-dev
libssl-dev
libminizip-dev

On other platforms, you need to make sure you have gcc version 8 or higher.


Troubleshooting:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lPocoNetSSL
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lPocoCrypto

Then you probably installed libssl-dev after trying to build.  This can be fixed by deleting the project/linux/linux_build directory and building again.
